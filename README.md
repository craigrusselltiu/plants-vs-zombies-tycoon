# Plants vs. Zombies Tycoon Code Samples
In this repository contains some snippets of code for my very first programming project. It's not quite possible to simply migrate the codebase to GitHub since a lot of functionality and scripting is integrated into the game engine, such as game instances and objects. Having said that, I still wanted to showcase some key pieces of code that I was able to learn to write that the game revolves around.

*NOTE: This code is not meant to run without the Roblox engine. These are only snippets of the codebase.*

## Script Descriptions
-   leaderboard.lua - Tracks player currency
-   products.lua - Handles microtransactions involving real transactions, interacting with the marketplace service
-   timecycle.lua - Handles time cycle, with days lasting longer than nights
-   purchasetycoon.lua - Handles purchasing a new tycoon
-   savescript.lua - Loads player data from data store upon joining game, and saves player data upon exit

## What I learned
- Programming Basics
- Variables
- For Loops
- While Loops
- Event Handling
- Data Store Interaction
